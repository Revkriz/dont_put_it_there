     <header>So You've Decided to Visit Our Page</header>

     Let's face it.  You have no friends and it will be another lonely night sleeping on the hand-me-down couch your ex left in your 
     studio apartment when she left with your old boss and her credit cards.  Broke and alone, you stumbled upon this mildly entertaining
     ,but still too good for the likes of you, website and you are probably a little stoked inside.<br>

</br>Here at Weiver Review we do two things.  Kick ass and take names...Well, we take names anyway.  We don't kick ass because we
     are only a little less pathetic than you.  What's your name anyway? (get name here)<br>

</br>Well, (insert name here) I'd like to say it is a pleasure to meet you but is actually a little depressing.  The good news for you
     is that you are now a VIP member forever memorialized in our guest book.  I know, it probably sounds too good to be
     true for someone like you, but here, see for yourself (link to guest book)<br>

</br>Impressive huh?  You know what else is impressive?  Being trendy.  Now you could probably go through life looking like everyone
     else in your pitiful little town, but who wants to dress like Elmer Fudd?  You'll never find love that way.  Check out these links
     to some swag that will do nothing for the loser you really are but at least you'll have a head start in social settings before 
     folks catch you doing self talk in the bathroom mirror but then break down in tears because even your reflection is too good to talk
     to you.  Don't worry.  It will all work out...the sales will I mean.  Not you, you're fucked.<br>

</br>Anyway, look at me, going on and jabbering.  I took up all this time you would have otherwise spent driving slowly by your old bosses
     house to see if your ex is still there, or following her around and digging her Pumpkin Spice Latte cups out of the trash and putting 
     your lips to the lipstick marks on the cup.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda...Since you are already doing things you regret, relentlessly, why
     not take a look around this site where you'll find loads of good ideas to make you sort of normal.
